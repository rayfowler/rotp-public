MAIN_ADVISOR_BUTTON_OK            | Dismiss
MAIN_ADVISOR_SCOUT                | Our logistics division reports that a pair of scouts and a colony ship are ready for deployment. I suggest we locate and colonize a nearby planet as soon as we can.
MAIN_ADVISOR_TRANSPORT            | The establishment of a colony at %1 was successful. The more transports we use, the faster %1 will develop into a cornerstone of our interstellar empire.
MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY            | Triumvir, I am thrilled to confirm our first contact with an alien civilization! Please, review our intelligence so that we can begin manipulating these aliens to better serve our ends.

MAIN_ADVISOR_RALLY_POINTS         | Our military forces are gearing up for war, but we'll need to mobilize our forces quickly. I recommend using rally points to fold our newly created ships into the fleet as soon as possible.
MAIN_ADVISOR_MISSILE_BASES        | Our strategists worry about the defensive capabilities of worlds at the edge of our territory. They recommend creating missile bases to fortify planetary defenses, and I agree with their assessment.

MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL              | Triumvir! A meeting of all interstellar empires will occur in only 5 short years. Direct our diplomats to improve how we are viewed, and we'll utilize our advantages to steer this Galactic Council to our ends.

MAIN_ADVISOR_RESIST_COUNCIL       | Seems that this'll be our final war one way or the other. I just hope all our past has taught us will be enough to prepare for what lies ahead...
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL_RESISTED     | Look at those foolish rebels! We've democratically been elected to lead this galaxy forward and all they can think of is war?! Then let's give 'em what they're asking for!

GAME_OVER_MILITARY_LOSS2          | Your best laid plans have been permanently foiled.#Yours was a species that had weathered hardships both external and self-inflicted. But here, in the depths of space, your people found a hardship they could not endure from foes they could not hope to match. Even when they stood united in the face of this common enemy, their strength and ingenuity proved to be outclassed at every level, and an empire that prided itself on the ability to maintain strong diplomatic ties fell to those it could not form a lasting bond with in the end.#There will be no more dreams from the people of Earth, no more writings, no more art, and no more songs. The hopeful voice of humanity that once sung out across the cosmos is now no more than a lilting refrain, replaced briefly by a baleful dirge, and then by a silence that will last into eternity...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_WIN2           | Your best laid plans have finally succeeded.#Rejoice, Triumvir! For now the long years of preparation and careful orchestration of your affairs have ended in absolute victory. Only a masterful diplomat could maintain friendly ties with the galaxy as it picked off enemies one by one, and only a brilliant tactician could lead their forces to success against such daunting and powerful foes. No doubt those you were able to convince to remain as your allies cursed your ultimate betrayal with their final breath: they are now no more than ink on the pages of history, and even then only if you decide to allow them to be so.#There will soon be a celebration across the Triumvirate such as humanity has never seen before. Since humans first looked at the stars they wondered if they were alone in the galaxy. Now, millennia later, that burning question has received its resounding final answer. 
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_ALLIANCE_WIN2  | Your best laid plans have finally succeeded.#Only a fool would think they could lead their empire to permanent peace without making friends along the way. You have proven beyond a doubt that you are no fool, unlike the enemies who sought to expunge you from the galaxy. In your time of need, it was neither strength nor cunning but strong bonds of friendship that proved to be your salvation. Now only miserable defeat is all the specters of your enemies know, while you and your allies are free to enjoy the fruits of prosperity together in perpetuity.#This battle, this victory, and this peace will prove valuable lessons for the descendants of all who were involved. They will learn how alliances are more powerful than the most terrifying of weapons, and that cool tempers will always prove superior to even the most deadly ferocity in the end. Relax and enjoy your prosperity, Triumvir, and know that your people will do the same from now until forever...
GAME_OVER_DIPLOMATIC_LOSS2        | Your best laid plans have been permanently foiled.#This should have been your crowning moment, the decisive diplomatic victory that secured your place above all other empires in the galaxy. Instead, your hopes were dashed in the eleventh hour by a usurper to the throne of the New Republic, whose diplomats proved to be even more persuasive and charismatic than your own. No doubt that all the work you had put in to forming alliances will soon turn against you, as the new ruler of the galaxy systematically convinces others that they were the one true ally, and that your words were only a deceitful venom designed to grant control of the future to you and your people alone.#Your diplomatic goals will now shift from advancement of your ideals to survival of your race. A single misstep could plunge your people into their final war. Watch the horizon closely, Triumvir: even the smallest and most unassuming of portents may become the beginning of the end...
GAME_OVER_ALLIANCE_WIN2           | Your best laid plans have ensured the survival of humanity.#While perhaps different decisions may have led to you taking leadership of the New Republic instead of your ally, none can deny that your superb political maneuverings have put you in a choice position. Due to your unbreakable alliance with the %6, you take heart in the knowledge that no one will dare threaten the Triumvirate when the response is risking the wrath of the entire galaxy. You've seen %8 and know its power, and as the most trusted confidant you will make sure that it is used to fulfill the desires of your people no matter the cost.#In the end, survival is in itself the ultimate victory, and beyond any doubt your people will survive in this unknown future. And who knows, Triumvirate: perhaps having the ear of the galaxy's new emperor will prove to be just as powerful as being the emperor yourself...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_LOSS2         | Your best laid plans have been permanently foiled.#Whether strength or fault, humanity had always possessed an intrinsic need to rebel against oppressors. Whether strength or fault, that need proved to be its final undoing. Perhaps it was inevitable when the human representatives failed to secure leadership of the New Republic for the Triumvirate. Perhaps it was a certainty that the %6, whose philosophy was entirely incompatible with the vision of the future that humanity had wished for, would prove a foe too powerful for even the enduring spirit of mankind to endure. There are many ways to ask "what if?", but now there is nothing but silence remaining to answer.#As %8 the galaxy, the last defenders of the Triumvirate fall and the empire crumbles to dust. The last glimmer of hope for them is that they put up a fight worthy of some remembrance, for they know as they die that to become ghosts of history is all for them that the future has in store...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_WIN2          | Your best laid plans have finally succeeded.#Those who thought you a meek leader capable only of brokering deals have lived to see the day they would regret such grave misjudgment. Though even you admit that diplomatic negotiations would have been the far better road to peace, you know that the galaxy cannot hope to move into its best possible future if humanity does not take the reins to guide it there. Those who voted against your rightful ascension can take the ashes of their New Republic with them to their graves: mankind will not be denied its rightful place among the stars!#Your bold and daring actions have led not only to the eradication of every other empire that called the galaxy home, but has caused the other two Triumvirs to cede their power to you in fear of what you are capable of. Take your place on the throne now as Emperor %2, and go boldly into the future that only you can realize!
GAME_OVER_REBEL_ALLIANCE_WIN2     | Your best laid plans have finally succeeded.#"There can be no true Republic that rejects the wishes of humanity." This was what you told the former Galactic Council as it betrayed you, and this is what you repeated to your people and your allies when the final battle ended in your victory. Years upon years of delicate political juggling and taxing diplomatic negotiations had been foiled in the final hour, but they were not for naught in the end. Now, you stand ready to take the throne, and you know that those brave enough to join humanity's rebellion will have no reason to oppose your ascension.#It was good for you to find kinship among some of the aliens that inhabited foreign stars, for they were instrumental in helping you achieve your goals of wiping out the false republic that built itself up around you. You will happily ensure that they take equal part in the building of the new future, and reap their equal share of the rewards as well. For the New Republic is no more, Triumvir: now begins the Grand Republic! Enjoy its challenges and its rewards: you have without a doubt earned them. 
GAME_OVER_DIPLOMATIC_WIN2         | Your best laid plans have finally succeeded.#After countless years, all the pieces are in place as your schemes reach fruition. It has taken diplomatic skill beyond any previously dreamed to orchestrate such unity among so different and disparate civilizations. Yet through all the setbacks and all the reconfiguring of your strategies, you sit now at the head of the New Republic without a single detractor in your midst. With no sign of rebellion on the horizon, the future of this galaxy is yours to shape. You need only direct your supporters to their tasks, and they will certainly see it done.#You will go down in history not just as the first leader of the New Republic, but as the legendary diplomat whose charisma and skill forged alliances so strong that not even enmity between foes could break them. They will study you in the Republic Academies until the very ending of the galaxy, and all will envy the time in which you live, wishing that they had just one opportunity to meet you and see in person the face behind the legend...
GAME_OVER_NEW_REPUBLIC_WIN2       | Your best laid plans have finally succeeded.#The New Republic is yours, Triumvir! Your political machinations made you the steward of this galaxy's future, venerated by all as a fair diplomat and a noble ruler. No one could anticipate the rebellion that rose up in response to your assuming the throne, yet the galaxy stood united behind you, proudly proclaiming themselves ready to die for your vision of the future. And though many of the bravest laid down their lives, it was the New Republic, not the rebellion, who achieved a total victory.#Now your era of peace can begin without delay. Though much work remains to be done, none can doubt that your chapter in history will be the most important one that ever has been or ever will be. Be proud of what you have accomplished, and be glad that you could inspire such devotion from so many different civilizations with different philosophies. Rest while you can, Triumvir, for another new test of your diplomatic skills surely lies just around the corner...
GAME_OVER_NEW_REPUBLIC_LOSS2      | Your best laid plans have been permanently foiled.#Of all the blunders to make as leader of the New Republic, it is difficult to say whether the largest one was overestimating your allies or underestimating your enemies. The existence of the rebellion was of little surprise: it is a given that there will always be those who will violently oppose any and all significant change. The speed and cunning at which they overwhelmed the New Republic forces was what truly took you by surprise. Outmatched and outgunned, you could do little else but await your inevitable end.#The rebellion is victorious, and the Triumvirate and its allies die along with the New Republic itself. The spoils of war now belong to the rebels, and it is they who will decide the direction that the galaxy will move towards from this day forward. If you are to be remembered at all, it will only be in your inglorious defeat. Had you been better suited to war, perhaps this galaxy could have known peace in the end...
