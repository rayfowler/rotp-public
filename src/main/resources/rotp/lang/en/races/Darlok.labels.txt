MAIN_ADVISOR_TITLE                | %1 Advisor
MAIN_ADVISOR_BUTTON_OK            | Dismiss
MAIN_ADVISOR_SCOUT                | We have finished construction on a pair of scouts and a colony ship. Let us hope the answers we seek present themselves on a nearby world.
MAIN_ADVISOR_TRANSPORT            | No answers found on the planet %1. We should still grow our numbers there by sending any transports we can spare.
MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY            | Representatives of a people native to this plane have made themselves known. We must do all we can to learn any answers they possess.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_ENGINE          | We have uncovered a way to produce more efficient engines. We must reach a consensus on how best to update our ship designs to utilize this new technology.
MAIN_ADVISOR_RALLY_POINTS         | An unavoidable conflict has begun! Our production facilities can direct their newly built ships to rally to a single world and form a fleet there to defend us from the aggressors.
MAIN_ADVISOR_MISSILE_BASES        | We have lost too much in coming to this universe to lose any more now: have our colonies protect themselves from enemies by building as many defensive missile bases as they can.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_WEAPON          | We've discovered new technology that improves the offensive capabilities of our starships. We must again decide how to update our ship designs to take advantage of this as soon as possible.
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL              | There are rumors of a gathering known as the Galactic Council which will soon occur. Our spies hope to use it as an opportunity to gather any intelligence they can. The future of our race depends on it!
MAIN_ADVISOR_REBELLION            | Have the people of %1 lost their minds?! They forget that only together can we prevail in this universe! We must make an example of this rebellion immediately!
MAIN_ADVISOR_RESIST_COUNCIL       | Our odds of success here were always known to be slim. Fighting against the Galactic Council and its allies does little to hinder our chances.
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL_RESISTED     | We have worked for too long to bend these fools to our will! Rebellion against our leadership cannot be tolerated! Destroy them at once!
