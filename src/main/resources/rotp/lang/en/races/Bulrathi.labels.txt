GAME_OVER_MILITARY_LOSS2          | The rage of your empire has been quashed.#The fury of your people was not enough to stem the growing tide of alien military powers. Though you fiercely fought to the very last soldier, the Bulrathi chapter in history has now come to an end. Once you were the Grand Hierarch of an empire, leader of a proud race of warrior philosophers who set their sights on the stars to find their place in the universe and test their mettle against those who dared to oppose them. Now you are only a name in the chronicles of this galaxy's past, and only then if the victors deign to remember you.#Perhaps, had you known of the end that awaited your people in their journey, you would not have charged forth into space so eagerly... 
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_WIN2           | The fury of your empire reigns supreme!#You stand now past the threshold of total victory over every empire that has made itself known to your people. Foolishly they thought they were capable of opposing your military might, only to find their fleets broken and their people scattered to face an ignominious end. Did they not recognize the fury in your hearts? Did they not detect the tenacity of your convictions? It does not matter now, for the victors need not concern themselves with the thoughts of the defeated, and none remain now to challenge the fact that you and you alone have dominated all who stood in your way.#Long ago your people set forth to find their place in this universe, and you have shown them that they were destined to rule this galaxy at the end of their journey. Hail victory, Grand Hierarch! Hail the Bulrathi Empire! 
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_ALLIANCE_WIN2  | None now remain who would dare challenge your fury.#As Grand Hierarch of the Bulrathi Empire, you feared that those you encountered in space would be incompatible with your vision of the future, and would need to eventually be destroyed. And indeed, many of them proved just that, though they all lie behind the bloody path the galaxy forced you to carve. But you have found reason to take heart, for not all that you have met proved so disagreeable, and you have found friends at the end of this long and tumultuous journey.#Perhaps it is better that you have found others to share this galaxy with in the end. The bounties of these worlds are rich, and the philosophies that guide your allies will prove themselves interesting considerations for your great minds to muse over for centuries. That is, of course, as long as they remain agreeable...
GAME_OVER_DIPLOMATIC_LOSS2        | The rage of your empire is cowed.#None could describe your efforts as anything less than valiant. Against overwhelming odds your people clawed a life for themselves in the depths of the cosmos, earning worlds for the empire throughout the galaxy. Unfortunately, your ferocity was no match for the superior technological innovations and political maneuverings of the alien races you encountered in space. Seeing that there was no means available to you that would enable your victory over the Galactic Council, you have taken the only choice you could: submission to the leader of the New Republic, and prevent a war that would surely wipe your empire out entirely.#Though your warrior spirit has been dealt a crushing blow, you know your decision to be the right one. At least, in the end, you have secured survival for your people as the galaxy moves into the future. The alternative to your decision was simply too horrible to imagine...
GAME_OVER_ALLIANCE_WIN2           | The rage of your empire is cowed.#Much has happened since you led your people from their homeworld in the hopes of helping them find their place in the galaxy. Your victories have gained much for your people, and many lands have been folded into the territory of the empire to ensure the Bulrathi a bright future. Unfortunately, the ultimate prize of leading the New Republic remained out of your grasp, with perhaps your ferocity on the battlefield inspiring too much fear to allow you your goal.#But all is not lost: a trusted ally has positioned themselves to lead the council instead, and was successful in convincing the other empires that their view for the future is the correct one. While your people long to see you as the ruler of this new future, you know you have chosen your allies well: together with the %8, you will ensure your people a place in the future of this galaxy no matter what the future holds...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_LOSS2         | The rage of your empire is quashed.#The wars of this galaxy have come to an end. Your people fought hard, with a rage and fury unseen among the other empires, but in the end their victories may have been your undoing. The ferocity with which your people fought acted as a foil against you, and an enemy was given stewardship of the New Republic as they convinced the council members that you were simply too savage to be trusted. As the %8 the galaxy, there was nothing you could do but delay the inevitable.#The Bulrathi Empire fell before its enemies in the end. As your territories are divided amongst the victors, and your relics and cities smashed into dust to be scattered on the winds of history, the legends of your people and their valiant last stand are unlikely to inspire fear in the descendants of those who will inherit this galaxy. In the end, after all, it is the victor who chooses what stories history will tell... 
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_WIN2          | The fury of your empire reigns supreme!#At last you have come now to the place you had known destiny would lead you: the total annihilation of every other race in the galaxy! Your unmatched fury proved to be overwhelming for your foes, who in their cowardice sought an alliance against you. Hoping their combined power would be enough to destroy you, they scurried like cowards out across the stars in an attempt to burn your worlds to ash. They were fools to believe this, and your people have shown them how vain their ambitions proved to be in the end.#Behold, Grand Hierarch, a galaxy that is yours for the taking. At your leisure you will add worlds to your fold. For your people and your people alone will you harvest the riches of the countless planets unopposed. And when you have taken all that this galaxy can provide, the time will come for you to direct your power to the galaxies that lie beyond...
GAME_OVER_REBEL_ALLIANCE_WIN2     | None now remain who would dare challenge your fury.#The sun rises on what was once the New Republic, with you taking the place you should have occupied from the very beginning. It was obvious how your former enemies would act when they united together, for their fear of you was so great that it unified them in paranoia of your power. Your rebellion was just; none could expect so great a warrior race as yours to grovel and plead like simpering weaklings. You even made the case that only doom would await your enemies, no matter how numerous they were. If only the fools had heard you!#However, you are not without mercy. Those wise enough to ally themselves with you will enjoy the fruits of a bountiful future with you, and their bravery and wisdom will be honored throughout your new empire. They are living testament to your mercy, and never again will they have any enemy to fear. That is, of course, as long as they remain loyal and agreeable...
GAME_OVER_DIPLOMATIC_WIN2         | The fury of your empire reigns supreme!#This galaxy and its denizens are yours. From the outset of your interstellar campaign, you have met many enemies and few friends. Though your battles were hard fought, the thrill of victory belonged to your people as those too foolish to see the error of their ways were made to face extinction. Those who remained saw not only a power they should fear, but an intellect that demanded their respect, and in the last meeting of the Galactic Council, you were chosen to lead what would be known as the New Republic into a shining future.#The time of testing your strength has come to an end: the time for testing your wisdom begins now. What the future holds for the republic led by the philosopher-king of the Bulrathi Empire is unknown. But one things is for certain: none now remain who would oppose your direction, for your indomitable strength provides all the assurances needed to assuage all doubt and fear from your newfound subjects. Hail the New Republic, and hail the Grand Hierarch of the Bulrathi Empire!
GAME_OVER_NEW_REPUBLIC_WIN2       | None now remain who would dare challenge your fury.#It was supposed to be an era of peace as you ascended the throne of the New Republic. While many empires found joy in following a strong leader to guide them into the future, a few short-sighted fools thought themselves wiser and stronger than the duly elected ruler of the galaxy. Your first test as steward of the New Republic was upon you swiftly, and your swift and decisive actions not only quelled the rebellion, but cemented your position as leader in one fell stroke.#Your enemies are the galaxy's enemies, and they lie broken and defeated before the combined might of your empire and the fleets of the civilizations who serve you. They will serve as a warning to those who threaten the republic in the future: Beware bringers of war, for this galaxy is ruled by the most powerful king ever known. Long may you reign, Grand Hierarch, and may your hard-earned future be brighter than your people could ever imagine!
GAME_OVER_NEW_REPUBLIC_LOSS2      | The rage of your empire is quashed.#Alas that these evil days are yours. After centuries of conquest and exploration, you had achieved your desire of being poised to lead the galaxy with a wise and powerful rule. The rebellion that sprung up to oppose your stewardship seemed to be small and doomed to failure in the face of your united alliance of powerful empires. But the rebels possessed cunning that you did not expect, and used it to counter your staggering physical prowess at every turn. Your inept allies proved useless in formulating a defense, and before it had even truly began, the dream of the New Republic was as dead as the civilizations that once comprised it.#Had things been different, this galaxy and all those who inhabited it would have moved forward together to a brighter time, away from strife and war. Now the future lies in the hands of the evil rebels who would go to any length to see you dethroned. It is they who will lose in the end though, for without your wisdom to guide them, their folly will surely lead them to the most dire of consequences...
