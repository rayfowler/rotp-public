MAIN_ADVISOR_TITLE                | %1 Advisor
MAIN_ADVISOR_BUTTON_OK            | Dismiss
MAIN_ADVISOR_SCOUT                | At last, we can begin to perfect the environments of worlds beyond our own. Prime Magister, send our scouts and colony ship to a nearby planet as soon as you can!
MAIN_ADVISOR_TRANSPORT            | We've established our first colony on an entirely new world. Once you send a transport, we can reinforce our numbers and solve the mysteries on %1 even more quickly! 
MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY            | Another people capable of space-travel have made contact with the Conclave. Let's open a dialogue with them and see how well they treat their own worlds. Then we will know how best to deal with them.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_ENGINE          | We've designed ship engines far more efficient than those we currently utilize. Let's develop new ship schematics as soon as we're able. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_RALLY_POINTS         | Our neighbors seem to find us... disagreeable. We can use rally points to direct our ships to a single location to prevent any damage to our beautiful new worlds. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_MISSILE_BASES        | It pains me to even consider defiling our worlds in such a way, but we can spare the space for defensive missile bases to protect them from even more unsightly damage. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_WEAPON          | There's been a discovery regarding more potent ways to damage enemy ships. We should definitely apply this technology to any new ships we produce moving forward. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL              | There's a meeting called the "Galactic Council" which all advanced civilizations will likely attend. This could be an opportunity for us to see which other empires would oppose the... expansion of the Conclave.
MAIN_ADVISOR_REBELLION            | Magister! There's a rebellion on %1. I don't know what the cause is, but I know what the solution should be!
MAIN_ADVISOR_RESIST_COUNCIL       | No way that we'll take this lying down, right? We're gonna fight the council now, right?! If we don't think of what will happen to those poor planets! 
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL_RESISTED     | Those disgusting rebels! We barely tolerated them even existing, and now they want to rebel? Give us orders to exterminate them: we have many of their worlds to claim for the Conclave!
