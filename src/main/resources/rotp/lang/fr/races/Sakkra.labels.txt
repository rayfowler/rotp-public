MAIN_ADVISOR_SCOUT         | At last, we can begin to perfect the environments of worlds beyond our own. Prime Magister, send our scouts and colony ship to a nearby planet as soon as you can.
MAIN_ADVISOR_TRANSPORT     | We have established our first colony on an entirely new world. Once you send a transport, we can reinforce our numbers and solve the mysteries on %1 even more quickly! 
MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY     | Another people capable of space-travel have made contact with the Conclave. Let’s open a dialogue with them and see how well they treat their own worlds. Then we will know how best to deal with them.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_ENGINE   | We have designed ship engines far more efficient than those we currently utilize. Let’s fit them on new ship schematics as soon as we are able. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_RALLY_POINTS  | Our neighbors seem to find us... disagreeable. We can use rally points to direct our ships to a singular location to prevent any damage to our beautiful new worlds. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_MISSILE_BASES | It pains me to even consider defiling our worlds in such a way, but we can spare the space for defensive missile bases to protect them from even more unsightly damage. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_WEAPON   | There’s been a discovery regarding more potent ways to damage enemy ships. I suggest, Prime Magister, that we apply this technology to any new ships we produce moving forward. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL       | There’s a meeting called the “Galactic Council” which all advanced civilizations will likely attend. This could be a great opportunity for us to see which other empires would oppose the... …expansion of the Conclave.
