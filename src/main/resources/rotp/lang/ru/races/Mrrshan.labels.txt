MAIN_ADVISOR_SCOUT         | Ah-ha! Our first fleet is ready my Khan! Let’s use it to find a world with enemies who’ve much treasure for the taking.
MAIN_ADVISOR_TRANSPORT     | We’ve taken new territory on %1. The more of us we transport from %3, the faster we’ll find any loot this world has that’s worth taking.
MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY     | We’ve made contact with a new alien race! Will they prove to be mighty foes, or will their treasures be easy pickings?
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_ENGINE   | We’ve found a way to improve our engines and make our ships even faster! If we incorporate them into our ship designs, our raids on enemy worlds will become even more efficient!
MAIN_ADVISOR_RALLY_POINTS  | My Khan! An open war is upon us! The Khanates will honor their pledge to unite in the face of a common foe, and wish for your direction on a rally point to send all their newly constructed fleets of war!
MAIN_ADVISOR_MISSILE_BASES | The rim worlds under our control are vulnerable to an enemy attack! Let’s construct missile bases on their surface to prevent them from falling into enemy hands.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_WEAPON   | We’ve managed to develop powerful new weapons for use on our ships. Once included in our fleet’s designs, they’re sure to cause a rout among the forces of our enemies. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL       | A meeting of mighty civilizations will soon be upon us, but it will be an exercise in diplomacy instead of an exercise of war. A strange occurrence, but we should attend this “Galactic Council”, if for nothing else then to placate our more uneasy rival empires.
