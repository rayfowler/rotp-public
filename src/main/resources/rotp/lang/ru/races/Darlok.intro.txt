The Darloks
The year is 31 PDB...

The Darloks achieve a sense of order and stability after ebbing the chaos that resulted from their unexpected dimensional breach. With strange new forms in an even stranger new world, they finally decipher the scientific truths of this universe and bring their technical understanding to a level that allows them to venture forth from Nazin. 
Still unable to reestablish a connection to their home plane, your people now bend their collective will to opening the door they once stumbled upon. 
The need to expand into space is twofold; not only does the answer to creating an interdimensional bridge most likely lie somewhere beyond their new home world, but the territory and resources required to sustain those who will need to make the crossing is substantial. 
You are one of the many who stand united by this great burden to find both the way and the means to save your people from the impending disaster that threatens their original universe. No cost can be considered too great to achieve success, for failing this endeavor means nothing less than the total extinction of your entire raceâ€¦
