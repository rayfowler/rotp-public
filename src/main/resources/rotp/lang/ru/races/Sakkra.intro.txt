As the last of the Ecodomes close over the disparate surface of Sssla, preparations also complete to enable the settlement of neighboring worlds. 
Recognizing that your people view the environment as an intricate puzzle that begs to be solved, the Great Families know how critical the presence of these puzzles is to maintaining order within the Conclave.

With your newfound authority as Prime Magister, you must ensure that your people are provided with a steady stream of planets to colonize and environments to bring to heel. 
You have often dwelt on the strange alien civilizations that certainly lie in the depths of space, and that your people will likely encounter them at some point in their expansion.
