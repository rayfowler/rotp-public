The Mrrshan Clans
The year is 2861...
You emerge from the Ancestral Halls as the newest Khan of the Golden Clan, the most powerful and prestigious of all the dominions on Fierias.
The Mrrshan have deep reverence for the ancient tradition of testing one’s mettle against rivals, acquiring tokens and trophies as marks of victory, and as a daring and cunning leader responsible for many legendary raids, your people have rallied to you in the hopes that you will lead them to untold glory.
As technology improves and allows for the exploration and settlement of nearby worlds, the different clans have come together in a loose accord, agreeing to share their resources, fleets, and technological innovations in the hopes that the eternal competition in which they take part can shift from increasing one’s trove by raiding rival clans to raiding alien worlds and taking everything that can be taken.
With your ascension coinciding with the labors of this pact coming to fruition, this proves to be a historic opportunity that cannot be missed. As your clan begins the first foray into the depths of space, you plan to position yourself to fully exceed your people’s wildest expectations...
