The Silicoid Imperium
The year is 12414...
As the Imperium end their search upon the desiccated surface of Cryslon, they find themselves unable to locate even the remotest trace of their eternal enemy Quaralon and his nefarious brood. 
Finding themselves the sole inhabitants of a planet otherwise entirely devoid of life, the Silicoids know that they must now leave their homeworld to locate their foes and terminate them with extreme prejudice. 
In the hopes of dealing a devastating first strike to the children of Quaralon, the Silicoids rush to develop the technology that will enable them to traverse the infinite Sea of Worlds before their enemies can achieve a similar technological prowess. 
You, the reigning Crystal Emperor, have galvanized the Silicoids from all walks of life on this noble crusade against a faceless nemesis, and prepared every facet of the Imperium to do whatever it takes to expunge the threat of Quaralon once and for all. 
Should your people succeed, all life in the galaxy will rejoice in your victory. Should your people fail, the toll of your defeat will be more terrible than you can even comprehendâ€¦
