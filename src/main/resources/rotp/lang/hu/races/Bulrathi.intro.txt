The Bulrathi Empire
The year is 142.15...

You sit upon the Throne of Might as the unopposed Grand Hierarch of the Bulrathi Empire. After a period of explosive technological growth under your wise direction, the people stand ready to follow whatever path you deem most prudent as their beloved philosopher-king. 
Knowing that you are the one destined to guide your people into the cosmos to claim whatever waits to be discovered therein, you command your advisors to complete work on functional starships as soon as possible. 
Your people have strength of heart and body, and the technology developed to enhance their terrifying physical combat prowess means they will easily overpower any feeble resistance they find in the depths of the galaxy. 
After fifteen years of rule, the time has come to compel the might of the Empire forward and conquer everything that lies in your path. Each world that you take will add to the size of your legions, the status of your station, the grandeur of your legacy, and the terror struck in the very souls of those who would stand in your wayâ€¦
