MAIN_ADVISOR_BUTTON_OK            | Dismiss
MAIN_ADVISOR_SCOUT                | At last, we can begin to perfect the environments of worlds beyond our own. Prime Magister, send our scouts and colony ship to a nearby planet as soon as you can!
MAIN_ADVISOR_TRANSPORT            | We've established our first colony on an entirely new world. Once you send a transport, we can reinforce our numbers and solve the mysteries on %1 even more quickly! 
MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY            | Another people capable of space-travel have made contact with the Conclave. Let's open a dialogue with them and see how well they treat their own worlds. Then we will know how best to deal with them.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_ENGINE          | We've designed ship engines far more efficient than those we currently utilize. Let's develop new ship schematics as soon as we're able. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_RALLY_POINTS         | Our neighbors seem to find us... disagreeable. We can use rally points to direct our ships to a single location to prevent any damage to our beautiful new worlds. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_MISSILE_BASES        | It pains me to even consider defiling our worlds in such a way, but we can spare the space for defensive missile bases to protect them from even more unsightly damage. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_WEAPON          | There's been a discovery regarding more potent ways to damage enemy ships. We should definitely apply this technology to any new ships we produce moving forward. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL              | There's a meeting called the "Galactic Council" which all advanced civilizations will likely attend. This could be an opportunity for us to see which other empires would oppose the... expansion of the Conclave.
MAIN_ADVISOR_REBELLION            | Magister! There's a rebellion on %1. I don't know what the cause is, but I know what the solution should be!
MAIN_ADVISOR_RESIST_COUNCIL       | No way that we'll take this lying down, right? We're gonna fight the council now, right?! If we don't think of what will happen to those poor planets! 
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL_RESISTED     | Those disgusting rebels! We barely tolerated them even existing, and now they want to rebel? Give us orders to exterminate them: we have many of their worlds to claim for the Conclave!

GAME_OVER_MILITARY_LOSS2          | The fate of all worlds is sealed...#You were once the hope of the countless planets that littered the galaxy. Setting out from your homeworld, your only concern was to learn about and perfect the unique ecologies of every world that could be found. As your knowledge increased, so too did the fervor of your people, and for a time it appeared that the shared dream of all Ssslauras would come true. If not for the greed of your enemies to expand their territories as much as possible, it very well may have.#Your colonies have been conquered to the very last planet: the loving care you gave to your biomes has been trampled by the bloodlust of your interstellar rivals. As the last of your outposts burns around you with your death an inevitability, you fleetingly ponder whether or not the fools who overpowered you will ever learn to live in harmony with the worlds they so blindingly take for their own. But the likely answer to that question, Prime Magister, is too horrible to dwell on...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_WIN2           | The salvation of all worlds is finally at hand!#Victory! Victory for your people and for all planets in the galaxy! From the day the Ssslaura Conclave burst forth from their world in search of new environments to safeguard, you knew the wish of your people would not be denied. It was misguided of your rivals to not see the wisdom in prioritizing the safety of this galaxy's ecological systems, but it was foolishness beyond comprehension for them to think that their strength was enough to stop you from achieving your goal.#Taking the simplest and most direct course of action, you elected to eliminate the threat that your rivals posed, and in doing so have prevented any more unnecessary pain to the biospheres that they so boorishly ruined for their own feeble ends! Now you have infinite time to repair the damage they caused with no one left to impede you. Your people will flow like a river throughout this galaxy, each planet a tributary waiting to evolve in peace under your guiding hand. Enjoy the fruits of your hard earned labor! And relish forevermore the challenges that await the Ssslauras on the path ahead!
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_ALLIANCE_WIN2  | The salvation of all worlds will soon be at hand...#Though not the ending you most hoped to achieve, you cannot help but smile as you bask in your well-earned victory. You knew there would be other races in this galaxy who would simply view their planets as resources to be exploited, ignoring the wisdom of your philosophy. Your people were prepared to fight to defend the sanctity of each planet, no matter how small. Now your enemies have turned to dust, and you know that the delicate balances of each ecological system will never be subject to the whims of those who would do them harm.#You were glad to find allies who heeded your message and were willing to treat their worlds with newfound respect as they learned from what you had to teach. To your great surprise, they even took up arms with you, doubtlessly defending their own interests, but helping you to defend yours as well. Now you can work on healing the damage caused by numerous and irreverent wars. In time, you can only hope to convince your friends to do so to their worlds as well...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_LOSS2           | The fate of all worlds is sealed...#The machinations of your rival empires have proven to be your undoing. As you traveled throughout the galaxy perfecting the ecosystems of each planet in turn, it was unavoidable that you would find worlds claimed by others which would remain beyond your reach. Through diplomacy and political maneuvering, you would certainly have been able to gain the ability to save these planetary environments even though they stayed under the grips of alien powers. Or so you thought.#Now the Galactic Council has disbanded and reformed as the New Republic under the leadership of the [leader_empire]. Your failure to convince the other empires to see the wisdom in your ways will doubtlessly cost both you and the worlds you were trying to desperately to save. You can only hope that the new leadership will be merciful to your people. Not just for their sake, but for the sake of every single planet in the galaxy as well...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_LOSS2         | The fate of all worlds is sealed...#Your tenacity and idealism has led you to this end. Your enemies have crushed your armies, and have done to your worlds things hitherto unthinkable. Once, you thought that by playing their political gamesyou would be able to sway their thinking to be more in line with your philosophy. But when the evil [leader_race] race took control of the New Republic, you knew that peaceful negotiation would become impossible. Ever the champions of ecological balance, your people swore to take up arms to prevent the mistreatment of the planets in the galaxy, and were prepared to die in doing so.#And die they have: your worlds have been conquered and your grand works upon each of them undone. Your people were forced to retreat to make their last stand within their final stronghold, and there they died in defense of your ideals. As the most ardent believers in ecological balance, your extinction will prove not just to be heavy loss for your people, but for the entire galaxy as well...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_WIN2          | The salvation of all worlds is finally at hand!#This is the hour of the Ssslaura Conclave! You have conquered every hurdle you have faced in building your interstellar empire, never once forgetting your first duty was to protecting the natural splendor of the worlds you claimed as your own. Any who dared oppose you were swiftly shown the error of their ways, and when the [leader_race] race was given leadership of the New Republic, you decided to show the entire galaxy how wrong its choice was in the most direct way possible.#There are now no enemies to oppose your will and no fools alive who are capable of harming the planets you safeguard. Your people can take their time finding solutions to the ecological puzzles that each world will present them. And when all the galaxy has been given perfect natural harmony under your guiding hand, you will be ready to take the worlds of other galaxies under your protection as well. Long live the Ssslaura Conclave!
GAME_OVER_REBEL_ALLIANCE_WIN2     | The salvation of all worlds will soon be at hand...#To say this sequence events comes as a surprise is a gross understatement. At first, the more peaceful solutions to inter-empire disputes seemed to be the best course of action to prevent unnecessary damage to the wondrous planets that populate the galaxy. There was, however, no course to take but war when the Galactic Council chose another to lead the New Republic. You raised the flag of rebellion against the entire system and the die was cast for the fate of the galaxy.#Unexpectedly, you found others willing to take up your cause and free the galaxy from what would certainly be ignoble oppression. Those who fought on your side proved to be just as tenacious as your people, and together you have wiped out the false order and installed a new system for the galaxy in which the well-being of all planets will be the highest concern. And should your allies decide to break from this direction in the future, you possess the knowledge on how to counter their tactics and strategies effectively. It is a joyous certainty indeed to know that every planet will reach its potential under your stewardship, no matter what...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_ALLIANCE_WIN2   | The salvation of all worlds will soon be at hand...#Truly this was the best outcome that you could have hoped for given the circumstances. From your first encounters with the other empires, you knew that their various shortcomings would prevent them from ever seeing the truth in your philosophy. Instead, you decided to build bridges between your people and the [leader_race] race, and help to propel them to a position that would be advantageous to your designs. Now, they sit upon the throne of the New Republic, and as their closest confidants, the Ssslaura stand ready to reap the rewards of their ascension. #You will continue to influence your [leader_race] allies to ensure the sanctity of each and every world in the Republic. Should a more obstinate empire seek to impede your will, you have every confidence you will be able to deal with of them. That is the strength of your bond to the [leader_race] race, and that will be how you will ensure the planets remain safe from now and forevermore...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_WIN2            | The salvation of all worlds is finally at hand!#You have achieved the victory your people have yearned for since they first journeyed into the cosmos. Encountering strange worlds with wondrous ecologies proved to be a rewarding challenge for your people to put their minds towards. Navigating diplomatic affairs, however, proved to be a far more delicate task for you to set your intellect to solving. But in the end you stand at the highest position of authority: you and you alone now stand as Master of the New Republic.#Using your position, you will ensure that every planet in the galaxy is handled with respect and with care. Should any empires within the republic go against this iron dictum in the pursuit of their own meager goals, you now have a galactic army at your disposal to ensure they fall back in line. And when these worlds have been perfected, you face a future of exploring other galaxies and bringing your blessed guidance to the worlds that lie within them. Go forth now, Grand Magister, for your work has only just begun...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_WIN2   | The salvation of all worlds is finally at hand!#Though not without setbacks, your will now stands unchallenged in how it will shape the galaxy. It was no small feat for you to become Master of the New Republic, but you were able to adapt to rival empires and their own subtle machinations. When some misguided members of the republic decided to foment a rebellion to maintain the freedom to destroy their worlds, it took little time for you to come to the conclusion that they must be exterminated. #Now the rebels have been put down and made into an example for those who would try to put their personal desires ahead of the well-being of their planets. The rebels were able to make themselves useful in a way you had not foreseen: with the rest of the galaxy united against a common foe, they are now more malleable to your will as they bask in the glow of a shared victory. This is the time for you to move forward with your plans, and whether or not those subservient to you are even capable of understanding why, you know in your heart that the galaxy itself will thank you...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_LOSS2  | The fate of all worlds is sealed...#Disaster has struck the New Republic before it was even fully realized. As your wisdom and compassion for the environments of all worlds spread throughout the intergalactic empires, it was a given that you would be the one called upon to lead the galaxy once it became unified under a single banner. But soon after ascending to this new throne of thrones, a rebellion began to grow and was eventually realized. As lines were drawn in the sand, you and those you led believed that your superior numbers and strength would lead to an easy victory. This complacence, it seems, would ultimately prove to be your undoing.#Those who rebelled against you had confidence in their abilities, and this confidence resulted in your empire crumbling around you. Now the entire New Republic has broken, each of its fleets destroyed and each of its worlds conquered by those who sought power for themselves no matter what the cost might have been. The rebels will now lead the galaxy into whatever future fits their own twisted designs, and as the life begins to leave your body, you only hope that they will show the planets they conquer with the mercy they refused to give to you in the end...
