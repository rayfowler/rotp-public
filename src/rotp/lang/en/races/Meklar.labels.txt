GAME_OVER_MILITARY_LOSS2          | Painfully reminded of the limits of your mortality...#Your dream lies as unfulfilled as your civilization lies in ruin. The alien lifeforms that comprised your rival empires had power beyond what you could match despite your insurmountably superior biotechnology. Despite your repeated assertions that your people sought nothing more than to be left alone in their search for life-extending technology, those very rivals did all that they could to thwart your ambitions at every turn. Perhaps they did so out of fear, perhaps they did so for sport, or perhaps they did so for no reason at all: whatever the reason, they chose to oppose you, and now your people are gone forever.#In another time, in another reality, your people would have found the immortality they sought and become a people who could experience the joy of shared eternal life. And in that eternity, in that reality, when time was no longer their master, the Meklar would have unlocked the secrets of the universe and existence itself. In this reality however, the Meklar are no more, and the Mainframe lies broken in the depths of Meklon, never to give sage advice again...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_WIN2           | No further obstacles in pursuit of immortality!#All your people wished was to be left alone to pursue their dreams of eternal life. From centuries ago when the use of mechanical bodies began, this single driving factor was at the heart of Meklar civilization. But to the Mainframe, it became apparent that these strange and limited lifeforms that you met on your quest throughout the galaxy posed a threat to your people being able to achieve what drove them into space so long ago. Whenever a decision for war was made, your military mobilized without hesitation, striking down your enemies one by one until now when none remain.#With no rivals to distract you or uncover knowledge to keep to themselves, you are now free to attain your ultimate goal as you see fit. This entire galaxy is full of resources that will enable you to find the answer that you seek as you spread your civilization to every corner in pursuit of your dream. And when your people have finally finished what they set out to do so long ago, this entire galaxy and its fruits will be yours to enjoy forevermore...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_ALLIANCE_WIN2  | With your enemies eliminated, you can now focus on immortality...#"What drove these creatures to wage war upon our people?" That is the question on which the Mainframe now dwells. For it, and all the minds of the Meklar are puzzled as to why seemingly intelligent creatures would act so rashly to hasten their inevitable deaths by striking against your people and their armies. For strike they most certainly did, and as was predicted by the superior intelligence that commands your society, so too did they fall.#Fortunately, not all were so foolish as to think themselves able to stop you from achieving your aims of immortality. You were able to make and keep allies who aided you in your wars, and made the doom your enemies faced all the more inescapable. You are happy to divide up the resources and the secrets of this galaxy with those who have earned them by fighting at your side, and when the day comes that your people reach their goal of eternal life, perhaps you will be happy to share that with your allies as well. Perhaps...
GAME_OVER_DIPLOMATIC_LOSS2        | Your quest now lies in jeopardy...#Your rivals have thwarted you without even knowing they have done so. Creating a unified republic of interstellar empires and marching to the future together under one banner was the most logical way for peace to be secured throughout the galaxy. But the likelihood that your people will be able to discover the key to true immortality has been shrunk to near zero, as bureaucracy and drawn out diplomatic negotiations will now certainly hamstring any progress you make, effectively grinding it to a halt. Where once you had the option of simply eliminating a species that insisted on making itself an obstacle, you know that now you dare not do so and risk bringing the wrath of the entire galaxy upon you.#Worse than that, the entire survival of your people now hangs on your standing with the %6 race, who have become the elected leaders of this New Republic. Any move you make that angers them will cause varying degrees of complications for your schemes. Where a minor insult may result in your freedoms of movement and information being stymied throughout the Republic's territory, raising their ire enough will surely spell extinction for you and your people...
GAME_OVER_ALLIANCE_WIN2           | Denied the throne, your quest may yet continue...#Few could ever hope to understand how deeply your people yearn to achieve immortality. Since first you began to meet other civilizations who possessed the capacity to travel amongst the stars, you have been regarded as dangerous, if not strange, by all those you have encountered. The one exception to the ignorance of your rivals has been the %6 race, who has regarded you with the respect your proud and ancient culture deserves and has been a shining light of friendship to your people in their darkest times. Now the %6 race bears the burden of leading the New Republic, and the Meklar stand to reap the rewards.#Through careful diplomacy and masking your actions, you believe it will be a simple matter to maintain harmonious relations with the new master of the galaxy, and in doing so will secure not only the future of the Meklar, but the future of your quest as well. With the Mainframe guiding your actions and the support of your people, what could possibly go wrong...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_LOSS2         | Painfully reminded of the limits of your mortality...#The gravest of injustices, that your people must now endure their extinction. The Mainframe, wise beyond all levels of understanding and possessing intelligence beyond measure, had determined that the ascension of the %6 race as the rulers of the New Republic would deny the Meklar the ability to ever fulfill their ultimate goal. To combat this, you were ordered to stage an open revolt against the galaxy itself to protect your future. Even though the Mainframe gave you no uncertainty that the outcome was likely extinction, this was a preferable fate to a future under the heel of your new masters if it would come to be. Unfortunately for you, it did.#Now the only immortality the Meklar will ever have is the immortality given to those who are recorded in history. Your history and your technology will be open for all to see and to use for their own purposes, and in the future even one of your formal rivals may succeed where you have failed and unlock the secrets of immortality...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_WIN2          | No further obstacles in pursuit of immortality!#The Mainframe has once again provided the insight you needed to secure the existence of your people. When the vile aliens known as "%6" had become the rulers of the New Republic, the Mainframe knew that no future existed for your civilization under the heel of such an oppressive and vindictive empire. Though your people knew that the likelihood of victory against the combined fleets of all the other empires in the galaxy, they marched forward into war gladly, believing in the wisdom of your ancient oracle above all else. With vigor and determination, the Meklar have fought long and hard, and now at last, they have won.#No one remains who is capable of thwarting or even temporarily impeding your people in their quest for immortality. The secrets of your fallen rivals will soon be extracted, studied, and used or discarded as you deem fit. Every world in this galaxy is yours for the taking, as are any secrets that they contain. It is only a matter of time before time no longer matters, for in the very near future your people will gain true immortality...
GAME_OVER_REBEL_ALLIANCE_WIN2     | With no more enemies, you can now focus on immortality...#You and your allies have changed the course of history. When the vicious and spiteful %6 race became the leaders of the New Republic, you knew without even needing to consult the Mainframe that your quest and your people were in the gravest of perils. Marshalling your fleets to assault the %6 menace and those who stood by them, your sounded a call of rebellion that echoed across the galaxy. Before the war even began, the call resounded amongst those you had allied, as only they were wise enough to see where the future would lead.#Together you crushed the forces of the New Republic and asserted your vision of the future as the true path to tomorrow. Now that the war is won, your reward is to finally be able to pursue immortality in peace. You will gladly leave your allies to their own devices in the hopes that they will return the favor to you. If they decide not to, either now or in the future, the call of war may be heard across the galaxy once again...
GAME_OVER_DIPLOMATIC_WIN2         | No further obstacles in pursuit of immortality!#The Meklar have now come into their own as the masters of this galaxy! Your people have always been the most driven and the wisest of all the empires who have set forth to conquer the stars, and their patience and determination have led them to this future in which their wishes will shape the future of this galaxy. Your quest for immortality is absolute, and now that you lead the New Republic unopposed, all the resources of this galaxy are now at your disposal.#The greatest minds of the subordinate empires will be put to good use in uncovering the secrets that will lead to eternal life for your people. Even the most aggressive of your former rivals will be cowed into submission by the threat of the power you now wield and could bring to bear against them. With the Mainframe to guide you and the resolve of your people stronger than ever before, you may rest assured without a doubt that immortality has now become an inevitability! 
GAME_OVER_NEW_REPUBLIC_WIN2       | No further obstacles in pursuit of immortality!#At last this trifle of diplomacy is at an end. For far too long you have been forced to endure the monotony of dealing with lesser species and their trivial motivations. You had hoped it would be finished when you had become leader of the New Republic, enabling you to spend less time worrying about the minutia of placating your rivals and more time focusing on your search for immortality. But life is seldom so orderly, and of course there were fools who rejected your ascension and rose up against you. But you knew just the way to put an end to these distractions once and for all.#With single-minded fury, you directed your fleets and those of your allies to eliminate the rebellion without prejudice. As the worlds of your enemies fell one by one, you came that much closer to being able to freely pursue your ultimate goal. Now that the rebellion is over, you are all too happy to let your allies attempt to achieve the goals that first pushed them to explore the cosmos. You will be far too busy in pursuing true immortality to worry about them anyway! 
GAME_OVER_NEW_REPUBLIC_LOSS2      | Painfully reminded of the limits of your mortality...#The events that led you to this point were so unforeseeable that even the Mainframe could not consider it a feasible outcome. Every step of your plan had gone just as the Mainframe predicted, from your favorable diplomatic position among the empires of the galaxy to your being granted to responsibility of leading the New Republic. A dissent strong enough to stir rebellion was always likely, and when one began forming you were not taken by surprise. What you failed to consider, and failed to react to, was the overwhelming strength the rebellion managed to garner, as your wildly unique appearance and culture led to far more misgivings than you could even possibly believe.#Though most of the leaders in the New Republic stood by you and moved their fleets to defend the unified order, you were powerless before the rebellion that you had believed yourself so capable of crushing. As your empire crumbled around you while the rebellion rampaged on, your people's own dreams of achieving eternal longevity died with them, just as your allies fell along with their hopes and dreams of a peaceful future for all...
