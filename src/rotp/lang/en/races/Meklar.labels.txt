GAME_OVER_MILITARY_LOSS2          | Painfully reminded of the limits of your mortality...#Your dream lies unfulfilled as your civilization lies in ruin. The alien lifeforms that comprised your rival empires had power beyond what you could match despite your insurmountably superior biotechnology. Despite your repeated assertions that your people sought nothing more than to be left alone in their search for life-extending technology, your rivals did all they could to thwart your ambitions at every turn. Whether done out of fear, for sport, or perhaps for no reason at all, they chose to impede you, and now your people are gone forever.#In another time, in another reality, your people would have found the immortality they sought and transformed into a people who could experience the joy of shared eternal life. And in that eternity, in that reality, when time was no longer their master, the Meklonar would have unlocked the secrets of the universe and existence itself. In this reality however, your people are no more, and the Mainframe lies broken in the depths of Meklon, never to give sage advice again...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_WIN2           | No further obstacles in pursuit of immortality!#All your kind wanted was to be left alone to pursue their dreams of eternal life. From centuries ago when your use of mechanical bodies began, this alone was the driving factor was at the heart of Meklonar civilization. But to the Mainframe, it became apparent that these alien lifeforms that you met on your quest posed a threat to what your people hoped to achieve. Whenever a decision for war was made, your military mobilized without hesitation, striking down your enemies one by one until none remain.#With no rivals to distract you or hoard secret knowledge to themselves, you are now free to attain your ultimate goal at your leisure. This entire galaxy is full of resources that will enable you to find the answer that you seek as you spread your civilization to every corner in pursuit of your dream. And when your people have finally finished what they set out to do so long ago, this entire galaxy and its fruits will be yours to enjoy forevermore...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_ALLIANCE_WIN2  | With your enemies eliminated, you can now focus on immortality...#"What drove these creatures to wage war upon our people?" That is the question on which the Mainframe now dwells. For it, and all the minds of the Meklonar are puzzled as to why seemingly intelligent creatures would act to hasten their inevitable deaths by pitting themselves against your forces. And as was predicted by the superior intelligence that commands your society, so too did they fall.#Fortunately, not all were so foolish as to think themselves able to stop you from achieving your aims of immortality. You were able to make allies who aided you in your wars, and made the doom your enemies faced all the more certain. You are happy to divide up the resources and the secrets of this galaxy with those who have earned them alongside you. And when the day comes that your people reach their goal of eternal life, perhaps you will be happy to share that with your allies as well. Perhaps...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_LOSS2           | Your quest now lies in jeopardy...#Your rivals have thwarted you without even knowing they have done so. Creating a unified republic of interstellar empires and marching to the future together under one banner was the most logical way to secure peace throughout the galaxy. But the likelihood that your people will be able to discover the key to true immortality has been shrunk to near zero, as the bindings of bureaucracy will now certainly hamstring any progress you make. Where once you had the option of simply eliminating a species that insisted on making itself an obstacle, you dare not do so now and risk bringing the wrath of the entire galaxy upon you.#Worse than that, the entire survival of your people now hangs on your standing with the [leader_race] race, who have become the elected leaders of this New Republic. Any move you make that angers them will doubtlessly complicate your schemes. Where a minor insult may result in your freedoms of movement and information being stymied throughout the Republic's territory, raising their ire enough will surely spell extinction for you and your people...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_LOSS2         | Painfully reminded of the limits of your mortality...#It is the gravest of injustices that your people must now endure their extinction. The Mainframe, wise beyond all levels of understanding and possessing intelligence beyond measure, had determined that the ascension of the [leader_race] race as the rulers of the New Republic would deny the Meklonar the ability to ever fulfill their ultimate goal. To prevent this, you were ordered to stage an open revolt against the entire galaxy to protect your future. Even though the Mainframe gave you no uncertainty that the outcome was likely extinction, this was a preferable fate to a future under the heel of your new masters. #Now the only immortality the Meklonar will ever have is that which is given to those who are recorded in history. Your knowledge and your technology will be open for all to see and to use for their own purposes, and in the future even one of your formal rivals may succeed where you have failed and unlock the secrets of immortality...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_WIN2          | No further obstacles in pursuit of immortality!#The Mainframe has once again provided the insight you needed to secure the existence of your people. When the aliens known as "[leader_race]" had become the rulers of the New Republic, the Mainframe knew that no future existed for your civilization under the heel of such an oppressive and vindictive empire. Though your people knew that the likelihood of victory against the combined fleets of the galaxy, they marched forward into war gladly, believing in the wisdom of your ancient oracle above all else. With vigor and determination, the Meklonar have fought long and hard, and now at last, they have won.#No one remains who is capable of thwarting or even impeding your people in their quest for immortality. The knowledge of your fallen rivals will soon be extracted, studied, and used or discarded as you deem fit. Every world in this galaxy is yours for the taking, as are any secrets that they contain. It is only a matter of time before time itself no longer matters, for in the very near future your people will learn to cheat death and live forever...
GAME_OVER_REBEL_ALLIANCE_WIN2     | With no more enemies, you can now focus on immortality...#You and your allies have changed the course of history. When the vicious and spiteful [leader_race] race became the Masters of the New Republic, you knew without even needing to consult the Mainframe that your people were in the gravest of perils. Marshalling your fleets to assault the [leader_race] menace and those who stood by them, you sounded a call of rebellion that echoed across the galaxy. Before the war even began, the call resounded amongst your true allies, as only they were wise enough to see where the future would lead.#Together you crushed the forces of the New Republic and asserted your vision of the future as the true path to tomorrow. With the war won, you can now pursue immortality in peace. You will gladly leave your allies to their own devices in the hopes that they will gladly return the favor. If they decide not to, whether now or in the future, the call of war may be heard across the galaxy once again...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_ALLIANCE_WIN2   | Denied the throne, your quest may yet continue...#Few could ever hope to understand how deeply your people yearn to achieve immortality. Since first you met other civilizations who possessed the capacity to travel among the stars, you have been regarded as strange, if not dangerous, by all those you have encountered. The one exception to the ignorance of your rivals has been the [leader_race] race, who has regarded you with the respect your proud and ancient culture deserves. Now they bear the burden of Master of the New Republic, and your people stand to reap the rewards.#Through careful diplomacy and concealing your intentions, you believe it will be a simple matter to maintain harmonious relations with the new ruler of the galaxy, and in doing so will secure not only the future of Meklonar civilization, but the future of your quest as well. With the Mainframe to guide you and the support of your people, nothing could possibly go wrong...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_WIN2            | No further obstacles in pursuit of immortality!#The Meklonar have now come into their own as the masters of this galaxy! Your people have always been the most determined of all the empires who have set forth to conquer the stars. Now their patience has led them to this future in which their wishes will shape the future of these innumerable stars. Your quest for immortality is absolute, and now that you lead the New Republic unopposed, all the resources of this galaxy are now at your disposal.#The greatest minds of the subordinate empires will be put to good use in uncovering the secrets that will lead to eternal life for your people. Even the most aggressive of your former rivals will be cowed into submission by the threat of the power you could now bring to bear against them. With the Mainframe to guide you and the resolve of your people stronger than ever before, you may rest assured without a doubt that immortality has now become an inevitability! 
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_WIN2   | No further obstacles in pursuit of immortality!#At last this trifling diplomacy is at an end. For too long you have been forced to endure the monotony of dealing with lesser species and their trivial motivations. You had hoped it would be finished when you had become Master of the New Republic, enabling you to spend less time with the minutia of placating your rivals and more time focusing on your search for immortality. But life is seldom so ordered, and of course there were fools who rejected your ascension and rose up against you. Fortunately, you knew just the way to put an end to these distractions once and for all.#With single-minded fury, you directed your fleets and those of your allies to eliminate the rebellion without prejudice. As the worlds of your enemies fell in turn, you came that much closer to being able to freely pursue your ultimate dream. Now that the rebellion is over, you are all too happy to let your allies attempt to achieve whatever meager goals they have. You will be far too busy in becoming immortal to worry about them anyway!
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_LOSS2  | Painfully reminded of the limits of your mortality...#The events that led you to this point were so unforeseeable that even the Mainframe did not consider it a feasible outcome. Every step of your plan had gone just as the Mainframe predicted, from your favorable diplomatic position among the empires of the galaxy to your being granted the position of Master the New Republic. A dissent strong enough to stir rebellion was always likely, and when one began forming you were not taken by surprise. What you failed to realize, and failed to react to, was the overwhelming strength the rebellion possessed, and now the price is yours to pay.#Though most of the leaders in the New Republic stood by you and moved their fleets to defend their unified order, you were powerless before the rebellion that you had believed yourself capable of crushing. As your empire crumbled around you, your people's own dreams of achieving eternal longevity died with them. And just as your allies fell at your side, so too did their hopes and dreams of a peaceful future for all...
