MAIN_ADVISOR_TITLE                | Mentaran Advisor
MAIN_ADVISOR_BUTTON_OK            | Dismiss
MAIN_ADVISOR_SCOUT                | High Councilor, our exploration fleet stands ready. Would you deem it most prudent for us to find a new world and create a settlement there soon?
MAIN_ADVISOR_TRANSPORT            | Our new colony has been established. The council is now deliberating on how many of our people we should send there on a transport ship, if we should send any at all.
MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY            | From the depths of space, an entirely new civilization has appeared! I pray that they prefer a peaceful co-existence over a violent one. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_ENGINE          | Our scientists have maintained a steady advancement on the technology of our starship engines. Representatives are now before the council offering suggestion on how best to use them. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_RALLY_POINTS         | It is unfortunate, but the Republic now finds itself in the midst of war. The council must decide on a rally point for our fleets to ensure our colonists remain safe.
MAIN_ADVISOR_MISSILE_BASES        | Instead of massing fleets of war, we can construct defensive missile bases on our colonies to protect them from invasion. The council wishes to hear your thoughts on what worlds would be best served by the presence of these bases. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_WEAPON          | The council is in heated debate about the newest design for ship weaponry. Some wish the weapons destroyed immediately, but we may wish to change our ship designs as a purely proactive measure.
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL              | Soon there will be a joyous meeting of the galaxy's greatest and powerful peoples. We should attend this Galactic Council and hear the wisdom of our celestial neighbors.
MAIN_ADVISOR_REBELLION            | That the population of %1 would choose to handle disagreement this way is most perplexing. The Council has given you leave to handle this immediately, even before they hear the issue. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_RESIST_COUNCIL       | It troubles me that all our efforts have led to this war, but if the only alternative is to submit to this warmongering council than I can see no other choice for our people! 
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL_RESISTED     | Does this not sadden you to see others reject peace so vehemently? Steel your resolve, High Councilor: this shall be the last war this galaxy ever sees.

GAME_OVER_MILITARY_LOSS2          | The Republic now lies in ruin...#Once, your people dreamed of a galaxy united, wanting no more than prosperity and tranquil coexistence for all. But the bitter truth of reality has made it clear that not all shared in your dream, and enemies with strength unimaginable channeled their efforts towards violent conquest. Manipulating the desires of your people to prevent your opposition, they used their machines of war to deal one devastating blow after another, and you were ultimately powerless to defend against them.#The tides of war have overwhelmed you as the last bastion of the Republic forces carry out their final stand. If your people had been less willing to let rivals surpass them in military strength, would your fate have been different in the end? As your enemies break down the entrance into the fortress in which you have made your last stand, your final thoughts turn grim as you realize you will never know the answer...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_WIN2           | Peace, at the most terrible of costs...#A terrible cost has been paid to achieve the dreams of the Republic. As your celestial neighbors became violent and uncompromising, you were forced to choose between the safety your people and total annihilation. Through numerous debates in the senate chambers, you made a terrible choice: to plunge your fleets into the fires of war, and pray that your people would survive. The result was bittersweet: though your people emerged victorious, they did so at the cost of all other intelligent life in the galaxy.#As the last vestiges of conflict echo out across the silence of space, a stillness overtakes the galaxy as a new age of peace is about to begin. The people of the Mentaran Republic, spread across numerous worlds, all look up to the sky together at the end of this last great war, but no cheers or sounds of celebration can be heard. Great sorrow grips your heart in this hour, for you realize that just the galaxy will never again know the horrors of war, neither will it know the joys of the diversity that life itself brings...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_ALLIANCE_WIN2  | Peace, but at a heavy cost#As your people spread your message of peace across the galaxy, you encountered numerous races who lent an ear to the messages your diplomats brought to them. Though some met your proposals with deceit and violence, there were those who listened earnestly and in time came to share your views. With lines drawn, those who heard your calls chose to stand as your allies in this fight, and together you weathered the storm of a great war. Though your people were forced to act against their most sacred and cherished principles, in the end victory was achieved, and now your allies can share in the fruits of prosperity that only peace can bring.#Though there is immense sorrow in the taking of so many lives and the erasure of vibrant civilizations, you know in your heart it was necessary to reach this final chapter in the history of your people: the last great war this galaxy will ever know has come to an end, and peace can reign at last. Whether or not that peace lasts in perpetuity, though, depends on the resolution of the allies you have made along the way...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_LOSS2           | Peace at last, no matter the cost...#Now comes at last the true test of your resolve. The Galactic Council has made its will known, and despite your unwavering desire for peace to be the guiding force in the galaxy, the Master of the New Republic will not be Mentaran after all. Though furious debates raged in the chambers of the senate, you were able to come to an eventual agreement. You have chosen to cede the right to lead to the [leader_empire]. But all your dealings with this empire have shown to you that they are a dangerous race, and there is no doubt in your mind that the leader of the New Republic will doubtless only maintain peace as long as it suits their goals.#And what will the Republic do if war comes to call? What will it do if its existence no longer suits the designs of the galaxy it now submits to? That will be a path that your people will need to walk in the future, and they will look to the decision you have made now as either the one that kept the dream of peace alive or the one that sealed their fate forever...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_ALLIANCE_WIN2   | Peace, though not how you desired it...#The decision of the Galactic Council to vote against you as their leader was not one met with enthusiasm amongst the Mentarans. Fortunately, you were wise enough to foresee this result and maneuver deftly to avoid a far worse outcome than the one that came to be: in your stead, the [leader_race] race will now determine the future of the entire galaxy.#As you rise along with the Mentar sun on the first day of this new galactic order, you still feel a sense of triumph for the way in which you were able to steer these events to achieve this ending. Your allies have proven themselves wise enough for this task, and while none can claim as much love for peace as your people, you hope that, somehow, you can trust the %8 to see your ultimate goal achieved...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_LOSS2         | The Republic now lies in ruin...#It seemed that fate itself had set out to thwart you from the very beginning of your journey. The difficulties that come from maintaining a space-faring empire and the constant threat of war from strange alien powers proved difficult enough to manage, but the final trial which simply could not be ignored came when the Galactic Council chose install the warmongering [leader_race] race as the Master of the New Republic. Knowing that the galaxy could not remain at peace with such a violent people to lead it, your people stood united in walking a path that would ultimately be their doom.#Your people had intelligence unmatched by any other species and were able to produce wondrous and devastating technology to aid them in the war. However, the combined might of the New Republic was far too much for you to overcome, and in the end your fleets burned as superior numbers proved more than a match for superior technology. Now, as the wheel of fate prepares to make its final turn, the last remnants of the Mentaran Republic are about to be expunged from the galaxy. A victim in what will be the first of many wars to come, and without your people to guide them to a brighter future, it is unlikely this galaxy will ever know the benefits that true peace can bring...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_WIN2          | Peace, but at a terrible cost...#The short lived New Republic is no more! Though all your efforts tried to steer the empires of this galaxy to co-exist in harmony, the empires themselves proved to be the biggest obstacle in achieving your dream of peace for all. In meeting your numerous attempts at diplomacy with faithlessness and treachery, your rivals backed you into a position for which there was only one means of escape. Now their fleets, their worlds, and their very empires lie in ruin, for even the combined power of the entire galaxy was no match for the superior intellect and technological might of the Mentarans.#Yet your heart weighs heavy, and rightly so. Though your historians will no doubt be kind in their treatment of your former enemies, it does not change the fact that each of these unique cultures has been wiped out, with no opportunity to add what they could to the shaping of the future. At least, High Councilor, your people are safe, and peace will be the only creed by which the future will abide. That is, of course, until your reach extends beyond this galaxy and to whatever awaits you in the unknown beyond...
GAME_OVER_REBEL_ALLIANCE_WIN2     | Peace, but at a heavy cost...#Long ago your people looked to the night sky with hope in their hearts, and your entire race was united in the quest for creating a massive space empire that existed harmoniously with its celestial neighbors. As your campaign comes to a close, you found your dream fulfilled in a way you did not expect and tried hard to prevent. Though a new galactic federation of empires was formed, the decision to appoint a violent leader to their highest position forced you to fight for peace one last time. Boldly you stood against the tide and declared war against this despotic regime, and against all odds you were able to succeed.#Fate smiled upon you in this endeavor, for others were inspired by your bravery and the tranquility you promised upon victory, and in this fight you did not stand alone. Your allies battled with ferocity that was unnerving in its zeal, and together you were able to crush those who would plunge the galaxy into an eternity of war and bring peace to this galaxy once and for all. The new era begins now, High Councilor, and you only hope those who chose to build it with you choose to adhere to its principles for as long as your people will...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_WIN2            | Peace at last, to the benefit of all!#Finally, your quest has reached its glorious conclusion! The trials you have encountered in your long years since setting forth into space proved to be more difficult than you could imagine. Though your people had long known that peaceful co-existence was the one true way, the mighty empires you encountered in your journey were in need of convincing. Through expert diplomacy and monumental patience, you were able to succeed in your ventures, and now you stand unopposed as the master of this galaxy.#Now a new test will begin. As the Mentaran Republic assumes leadership of the galaxy, your civilization will set the example for all others to follow. More difficulties await you in the future as old tensions and cultural differences will surface and strain the peace you have worked so hard to achieve. But you know that as long as your people remain steadfast in their vision, no living being in this galaxy need ever experience the terrors of war ever again! 
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_WIN2   | Peace at last, though bittersweet...#Once you assumed leadership of the New Republic, you hoped that it would mark a new beginning for the galaxy in which violence and war would yield to peace and prosperity. However, your hopes were quickly dashed, as the most vicious denizens of the galaxy rose up to reject your ruling and steeped all known empires into yet another horrid war. Seeing the last chance for peace slip away before your eyes, you made the only decision you could: to meet their aggression with the full force of the New Republic, and together you and your allies sent your fleets to restore order to the galaxy.#With the rebels ground to dust, peace can at long last be given its due. It is sad that so many voices have denied themselves a right to help shape the bright future that lies ahead, but you cannot give much time to the grief that weighs heavy on your heart. They chose their fate, and their fate was delivered to them. Now, High Councilor, the new era dawns with you at the helm. There is still so much work left to do...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_LOSS2  | The New Republic lies in ruins...#A terrible fate has befallen you. Just as your quest was finally coming to an end and you were about to harvest the fruits of your long labors, your dream of a peaceful federation of empires was snatched away from you. Though many in the Galactic Council desired harmony and prosperity and saw that you were the one destined to lead the galaxy into such a future, a vile rebellion sprang forth as those most prone to violence were unwilling to put aside their primal need for savage ferocity. Against your own ideals, you led the forces of the New Republic to meet this threat, and against such overwhelming force you could not bring about victory.#Now the galaxy is far more empty than it was before, as your proud and noble civilization has been entirely expunged. As your enemies mock your principles as weak and idealistic, you know too that history will be equally unkind to your failure. Those that remain will quake under tyranny and war, and violence will rule in place of peace. This is the ending you least wanted to this long and difficult struggle, and for you, at least, the story has come to a most unfortunate end...
