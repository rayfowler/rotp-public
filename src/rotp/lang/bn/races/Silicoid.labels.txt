GAME_OVER_MILITARY_LOSS2          | Your holy crusade has come to a dismal end.#Each and every world within the long-lived Cryslonoid Imperium has been conquered, or worse, by strange and alien creatures. You were the Crystal Emperor who promised to lead your people to the fulfillment of their most ancient and sacred prophecy: to rid the galaxy once and for all of the foul Brood of Quaralon. Instead you have led them only to ruin, and as the sun rises over the last Cryslonoid colony to hold out against the alien hosts, the magnitude of your failure will soon be felt by the empires who remain in this galaxy. #The Imperium has been extirpated, forever, and with your people gone, it is doubtless that Quaralon's nefarious offspring will rule over this galaxy uncontested, from now until the end of time...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_WIN2           | Your holy crusade has ended in supreme victory!#Unable to confirm the identity of your most ancient enemy, you have chosen the only option available to you: slaughter all who inhabit this galaxy without mercy. No race was able to prove themselves superior to your indomitable zeal and your unrelenting strength. Each has fallen in turn, and their worlds have now been cleansed from any possible influence of Quaralon's filth. And to ensure that they remain clean, the Imperium will bring every planet into the fold, inhabit them, and guard them until the end of time.#Your empire will now doubtlessly endure until the very ending of existence, and none will ever rise to oppose you again for indeed none remain to do so! Long live the Crystal Emperor! Long live the Imperium!
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_ALLIANCE_WIN2  | Your holy crusade has at last come to fruition.#While you were unable to ascertain the true identity of the Children of Quaralon, some of those who inhabit the galaxy were able to prove themselves unlikely to be the spawn of your most hated foe. Those who could not do so have met their ultimate fate at the hands of your unbreakable legions. Now all that remains are you and those who have shown themselves to be loyal and pure of heart, and the galaxy is yours to do with as you will.#Alas, should you be wrong about the identity of those you have allowed to remain alive, your crusade may one day need to resume all over again...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_LOSS2           | Your holy crusade has come to a dismal end.#Throughout your journey across the galaxy, you have fought wars, conquered worlds, and made alliances with numerous alien civilizations. Yet despite your best efforts, you found yourself able to neither convince the empires that litter the cosmos of the threat posed to them by Quaralon's brood nor wield a military force powerful enough to force them to comply with the dictums of the crusade. Now they have chosen the miserable [leader_race] race to lead them into the future.#While they hope the future will be prosperous and peaceful, only you know the truth of what awaits all those who would not be swayed to your cause. Perhaps, in the future, another Crystal Emperor will succeed where you have failed, and one day the fires of your holy war may burn once more...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_LOSS2         | Your holy crusade has come to a dismal end.#With the formation of a new republic under the Galactic Council led by the wicked [leader_race] race, the only possible choice for you was an ill-fated rebellion in hopes of ensuring that your righteous war could endure. Though hope was never in abundance on the course you chose, it was nonetheless there, and had your decisions been more wisely chosen, perhaps you would have even managed to bathe in the light of victory.#But there is no light left for you or the Imperium, and as %8 the galaxy, your final thoughts are on Quaralon and his children, your failure to find and destroy them, and the brutal fate that now awaits this galaxy with your people no longer there to defend it...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_WIN2          | Your holy crusade has ended in supreme victory!#The pathetic empires of the galaxy had made the most foolish of choices. In uniting under the banner of the miserable [leader_race] race and turn themselves from the demands of your crusade, they chose to seal their fate as well as that of the rest of the galaxy. But you, the Crystal Emperor, knew that this could not stand, and with the skill of only the most legendary heroes you led your people to victory in an impossible war against the entirety of the galaxy!#If only the fools had heeded your warnings, perhaps they would have lived to see the error of their ways. But now, at last, the galaxy can endure the only true peace it could ever know. Hail to victory, Crystal Emperor! Hail the might of the Cryslonoid Imperium!
GAME_OVER_REBEL_ALLIANCE_WIN2     | Your holy crusade has come to fruition.#As the last of your enemies falls before you, you feel the thrill of progress made by your crusade since it first began. It was an error for the pathetic races that inhabit this galaxy to choose the [leader_race] race to lead them away from the call of the crusade. In turning from your wisdom they had defied both you and the prophecy of Chryslon: an act that could not be tolerated, and one they would no doubt have come to regret if they had lived long enough to do so.#Only those wise enough to heed your warnings, and aid you in your war, can now revel in the newfound peace bestowed on the galaxy with the threat of Quaralon eliminated once and for all. Of course, should they themselves prove to be Quaralon's children in disguise...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_ALLIANCE_WIN2   | Your crusade has come to an unexpected end.#The Cryslonoid Imperium has done much on its quest throughout the galaxy. Under your leadership, your people have encountered numerous alien civilizations. Many of these races have proven themselves enemies and potential carriers of Quaralon's vile blood. Yet unexpectedly, some have proven themselves friends to your ancient empire. Now, on the eve of the creation of the New Republic, you have cast your vote for the [leader_empire], allowing them to rule over a new era of peace in the galaxy.#As you prepare to cede the future to the %8, you only hope that their strength and wisdom will be enough to protect the galaxy from the greatest evil of your ancient prophecy. For if you have chosen wrong, the peace promised by the forging of this alliance will prove short lived indeed...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_WIN2            | Your holy crusade has at last come to fruition.#Once the Crystal Emperor of the Cryslonoid Imperium, you now stand as Master of the New Republic formed by the various empires of the Galactic Council. Not a single race has dared to raise an objection to this ordained fate, doubtlessly realizing that their energies are better spent in aiding your cause. For the enemies of the Imperium are now the enemies of the galaxy, and that can only spell doom for the Children of Quaralon.#Should you find them skulking in the galaxy, every race will unite beneath your banner and excise them completely. Should you find them concealed among the races of the council, woe betide those who dared to hide themselves from you for so long...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_WIN2   | Your holy crusade has at last come to fruition.#After your ascension to the throne of the council and your duly elected rule of the New Republic began, the stage was set for a new chapter in the crusade to purge the filth of Quaralon's brood from the galaxy. The rebellion against you was ill-conceived and doomed to fail from the beginning, and the lives lost in quashing it were not wasted: in proving your capabilities as a commander you have cemented yourself as a ruler not merely to be respected, but to be feared as well.#The entire military of the New Republic stands behind your banner and is ready to do whatever the needs of the crusade demand. Your ancient enemy will have nowhere to hide, and should Quaralon's ilk be among those you now rule, the entire might of the galaxy will be brought against them in swift retaliation. You need only find where your enemy hides to start the Final War and bring the galaxy to peace forever...
GAME_OVER_COUNCIL_MILITARY_LOSS2  | Your holy crusade has come to a dismal end.#You stood as Master of the New Republic, ready to lead legions into battle against the enemy of prophecy. However, the rebellion that rose against you was unexpected, and, unfortunately, far too much for you to deal with. Whether due to the cowardice of your supplicants or the military mistakes that you made as commander, the Cryslonoid Imperium is no more, and lesser races now infest your worlds.#With the fall of the Imperium and the death of the short-lived New Republic, none now stand who will be able to find Quaralon's spawn, let alone defeat them and bring peace to the galaxy. Perhaps had you been more apt to command your armies, the prophecy would have been fulfilled and disaster averted. Now with your defeat, that prophecy stands buried in the sands of time, never to be fulfilled, or even known, again...
