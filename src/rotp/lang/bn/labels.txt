SHIP_DESIGN_HELP_ALL              | OVERVIEW - an empire can have up to six active ship designs. For each design, choose a hull size then fill it with various components such as armor, shields and weapons. Each component has a size, power and cost. The total space required for a component is its size plus the size of the number of engines needed to power it. Once deployed, a ship design can be constructed in any of your colonies.

SHIP_DESIGN_HELP_1G               | Hit Points - damage required to destroy this ship in combat.
SHIP_DESIGN_HELP_1H               | Missile Defense - defense level vs. missile weapons in combat.
SHIP_DESIGN_HELP_1I               | Beam Defense - defense level vs. beam weapons in combat.
SHIP_DESIGN_HELP_1J               | Attack Level - attack level for weapons in combat. 
SHIP_DESIGN_HELP_1K               | Combat Speed - distance the ship can travel in combat, per turn.
SHIP_DESIGN_HELP_1L               | Tint - alters the color of the ship.
SHIP_DESIGN_HELP_2A               | Engine Type - the type of engine used to power this ship design.
SHIP_DESIGN_HELP_2B               | Speed - travel speed provided by the engine.
SHIP_DESIGN_HELP_2C               | Cost - the cost of each engine needed for power.
SHIP_DESIGN_HELP_2D               | Size - hull space required per engine.
